Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum (what′s wrong with me?)
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum (why do I feel like this?)
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum (I'm going crazy now)
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum

No more gas, in the red
Can′t even get it started
Nothing heard, nothing said
Can't even speak about it
All my life on my head
Don't want to think about it
Feels like I′m going insane, yeah

It′s a thief in the night to come and grab you (aha)
It can creep up inside you and consume you (aha)
A disease of the mind, it can control you (aha)
It's too close for comfort, oh


Put on your brake lights
You′re in the city of wonder
Ain't gon′ play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter, be wise

Your mind is in disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia
Am I scaring you tonight? (your mind is in)
Disturbia
Ain′t used to what you like
Disturbia, disturbia

Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum

Faded pictures on the wall
It's like they talkin' to me
Disconnected, no one calls
The phone don′t even ring
I gotta get out or figure this shit out
It′s too close for comfort, oh


It's a thief in the night to come and grab you (aha)
It can creep up inside you and consume you (aha)
A disease of the mind, it can control you (aha)
I feel like a monster, oh

Put on your brake lights
You′re in the city of wonder (city lights)
Ain't gon′ play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice (think twice)
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter, be wise (be wise)

Your mind is in disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia
Am I scaring you tonight? (your mind is in)
Disturbia
Ain′t used to what you like (what you like)
Disturbia, disturbia

Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum (Disturbia)
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum (oh-oh)

Release me from this curse I'm in
Trying to maintain, but I'm struggling
If you can′t go-o-o-o-o-o
I think I′m gonna ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Put on your brake lights
You're in the city of wonder
Ain′t gon' play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice (better think twice)
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter, be wise (so if you must falter, be wise)

Your mind is in disturbia
It′s like the darkness is the light
Disturbia
Am I scaring you tonight? (your mind is in)
Disturbia
Ain't used to what you like
Disturbia, disturbia
